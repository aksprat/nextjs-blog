# Why Next.js?
Beginner-friendly: Next.js abstracts many complexities of setting up a React app with server-side rendering, making it easier to get started.
Versatile: It supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR).
React-based: React is a widely-used JavaScript library, making this project relevant for many developers.
Easy to extend: Developers can easily customize and extend Next.js applications with additional features.
Active Community: There is a strong community around Next.js, providing plenty of resources and plugins.
